# Drone-school-simulator-website

An example landing page for my **Drone School Simulator** game.  
This repository contains a sample website created to showcase and present my self-developed drone training simulator.

## Purpose
This project is also my **learning playground** for web development. I built the initial layout using **HTML + CSS**, and now I’m focusing on **JavaScript** to make the website interactive and more dynamic.

## Current Status
🚧 The website is **still under development** and will be updated frequently as I learn and implement new features.

## Learning Goals (Next 30 Days)
For the next month, I’ll dedicate **~1 hour per day** to learning and practicing JavaScript by improving this website.

Planned topics and features:
- DOM basics (selecting elements, changing content/styles)
- Button interactions and UI states (disable/spam protection, loading states)
- Modals / popups (e.g., controls or help window)
- Interactive sections (show/hide, tabs)
- Screenshot gallery improvements (lightbox viewer)
- Basic form handling and validation
- Clean and reusable JS functions

## Updates
I will commit updates regularly to track progress and document what I learn each day.
