Initial website launch for <strong>Drone School Simulator</strong>. This page is now actively used as a development hub where I share progress updates, development milestones, and upcoming features. The website itself is part of my learning process, combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript practice while showcasing the evolution of the game.

<p>
Basic drone controls system implemented. Players can now access a detailed controls tutorial through the in-game computer interface, allowing them to learn movement, rotation, and camera control before entering the training zones. This step improves accessibility for new players and makes the learning curve smoother.
</p>

<h1>2026/01/22</h1>
<p>
Training zone environment added to the game. The first flight practice area is designed to help players understand smooth movement, altitude control, and basic drone handling in a safe and controlled environment. This zone serves as the foundation for future advanced training scenarios.
</p>

<p>
Early prototype phase started. Core gameplay ideas were tested, focusing on teaching drone piloting through interactive training scenarios rather than traditional missions. Initial systems were built to validate controls, camera behavior, and player feedback during flight.
</p>

<h1>2026/01/10</h1>
<p>
Project planning and concept design completed. The overall vision for Drone School Simulator was defined, including learning-based gameplay, training progression, and future expansion ideas such as advanced flight challenges and realistic simulation elements. Development officially begins on the project.
